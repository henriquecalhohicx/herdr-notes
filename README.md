# Herdr Notes

### The scratch note that lives beside your agents.

One markdown note per tab in a dockable [herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr)
pane — rendered preview, plain-text editing, and it never forgets: everything
autosaves and survives computer restarts.

That's the note docked on the right, keeping its shape while the test suite runs
next door. Terminals are where the work happens, and the work generates thoughts —
half-finished todo lists, commands you keep retyping, things to ask about later.
This gives them a permanent home one keypress away: no editor window, no stray
`notes.txt`, no saving.

```
herdr plugin install alexarthurs/herdr-notes
```

## Why you'll keep it open

- **Rendered markdown** — headings, checkboxes, lists, quotes, code blocks
  and inline styles, drawn natively in the terminal with a scrollbar.
- **Zero-friction editing** — `e` to type, `Esc` to go back. That's it.
- **A note per tab** — every herdr tab keeps its own note, keyed to the tab
  itself. Open Notes in as many tabs as you like; each is its own document.
- **Actually persistent** — atomic autosaves to a per-tab JSON file in
  herdr's config directory. Close the pane, kill the terminal, reboot: it
  comes back.
- **A polite pane** — one toggle action opens, focuses, or closes it;
  a heartbeat token means a dead pane gets replaced, never duplicated.

## Install

From a checkout of this repo:

```
cargo build --release
herdr plugin link .
```

Or straight from GitHub with the command under the hero image.

## Open

One toggle action, scoped to the current tab — it opens the pane docked on
the right edge, focuses it if it's already open, and closes it if it's focused:

```
herdr plugin action invoke herdr-notes.open-notes-windows   # windows
herdr plugin action invoke herdr-notes.open-notes           # linux / macos
```

First run greets you with the keymap:

## Keys

Preview (default):

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `e` / `Enter` | edit the note |
| `Up` `Down` `PgUp` `PgDn` | scroll |
| `g` / `G` | jump to top / bottom |
| `x` | clear the note (y/N confirm) |
| `q` | quit |

Edit:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Esc` | back to preview (saves) |
| `Ctrl+S` | save now (autosave runs anyway, ~2s after the last keystroke) |

`Esc` never exits the app.

## Persistence

Each herdr tab gets its own note, stored as `<tab-key>.json` in herdr's
per-plugin state directory (`HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` — e.g.
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\herdr\plugins\herdr-notes\` on Windows), keyed by the
`HERDR_TAB_ID` herdr injects into every pane (its `:` separator sanitized to
`_`, so tab `w1:t2` → `w1_t2.json`). Closing a tab just orphans its file;
delete `<tab-key>.json` by hand if you want it gone. Run outside herdr, the
pane falls back to `herdr/notes/` under the platform config dir (single
shared `notes.json` when there's no tab id), and any note found in the
fallback layout is moved into the state dir on first load — an existing note
is inherited, never lost.

The format is `{ "text": "...", "mode": "preview"|"edit" }`. Saves are
atomic (temp file + fsync + rename) and happen on leaving edit mode, clear,
quit, and debounced while typing. A missing or corrupt file falls back to
an empty note — it never wedges the pane.

## Hacking

`CLAUDE.md` has the build/dev workflow and the hard-won herdr/Windows
gotchas (pane spawning, heartbeats, PowerShell 5.1 quirks). The short
version: `cargo build --release`, `cargo test`,
`cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, all green before shipping.
