# open-notes.sh — unix launcher for the herdr-notes pane.
#
# Idempotent "launch-or-focus, toggle on repeat", scoped to the FOCUSED
# pane's tab (each tab has its own note file; the binary matches panes by
# note-FILE identity, see state.rs note_key):
#   - no Notes pane on that note file       -> open one in the current tab,
#     DOCKED ON THE RIGHT edge (a second live instance on the same note file
#     would clobber it on save)
#   - a Notes pane exists but isn't focused -> focus it
#   - the focused pane IS the Notes pane    -> close it (toggle off)
#   - Notes pane with a stale heartbeat     -> close the corpse, open fresh
#
# Right dock: split the tab's RIGHTMOST pane to the right. `pane split --ratio`
# is the ORIGINAL pane's share, so ~0.7 leaves the new Notes pane ~0.3 on the
# right edge — no `pane swap` needed.
#
# All ids/ratios come from the binary's unit-tested stdin modes
# (--launch-decision / --focused-pane / --open-plan), never ad-hoc JSON
# parsing; the ids it emits are validated flag-safe before reaching an argv.
